    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Undergraduate Research Assistant</strong> — <em>BYU CS Department</em>, Provo, UT April 2021 – Present
        <ul>
          <li>Research about interactions between users and swarm-based robots.</li>
          <li>Using Python, implement a simulation representing how ants find new homes.</li>
          <li>Using Pygame, add 4 different interfaces for different purposes and user controls.</li>
          <li>Currently have a user-friendly, interactive simulation ready to test many parameters
            relating to how users interact with the ant colony to help them accomplish their goal.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <br/>
      <li>
        <strong>Software Designer</strong> — <em>Wolf Tech</em>, Provo, UT August 2021 – September 2021
        <ul>
          <li>Need a device to scare predators away when they approach livestock.</li>
          <li>Using Arduino UNO, design a device that sets off an alarm at a frequency
            that scares wolves but not cows when the cows’ heart rate
            rises (due to being alarmed by the wolves).</li>
          <li>Made a simplified prototype that sets off an alarm when a
            potentiometer is turned too far.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <br/>
      <li>

        <ul>
          <li>Answered questions about propositional logic, sets, relations, and graphs for 15 hours a week.</li>
          <li>Met with many students throughout each working period.</li>
          <li>Students were enlightened and encouraged through our meetings.</li>
